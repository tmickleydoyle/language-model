But instead of eating food, plants use sunlight, water, and air to make sugar (their food). \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Plants drink water through their roots\n2. They breathe in carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves\n3. Sunlight gives them the energy to mix these together\n4. This creates sugar for the plant to eat and oxygen for us to breathe!\n\nSo plants are like little food factories that also help us by making the oxygen we need!",

The process involves feeding algorithms large amounts of data so they can identify patterns and make predictions.

The algorithm improves its performance over time as it processes more data, similar to how humans learn from experience.",
