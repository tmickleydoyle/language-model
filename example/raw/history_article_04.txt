The American Civil Rights Movement was a pivotal era in United States history. Spanning the 1950s and 1960s, it sought to end racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X inspired millions through peaceful protests, speeches, and acts of civil disobedience. Landmark legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, helped dismantle institutional racism. The movement's legacy continues to influence social justice efforts today.
