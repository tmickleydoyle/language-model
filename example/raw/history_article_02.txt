The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic structures in the world. Built over centuries, it stretches more than 13,000 miles across northern China. The wall was constructed to protect Chinese states from invasions and raids by nomadic tribes. Workers used stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood to build the wall, often in harsh conditions. Today, the Great Wall stands as a symbol of China's rich history and the determination of its people. It attracts millions of visitors each year, who marvel at its scale and the stories it holds.
