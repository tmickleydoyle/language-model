Robotics is a field of engineering that designs and builds machines capable of performing tasks automatically. Robots are used in manufacturing, healthcare, and even space exploration. Some robots are controlled by humans, while others operate independently using artificial intelligence. Advances in robotics are making it possible for machines to perform complex tasks, from surgery to disaster response. The future of robotics holds exciting possibilities for society.
