Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, are essential for a sustainable future. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, while wind turbines harness the power of moving air. Hydroelectric dams use flowing water to generate energy. These sources produce little or no pollution and help reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Governments and businesses are investing in renewable energy to combat climate change and protect the environment.
