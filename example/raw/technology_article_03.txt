Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important as the world seeks to reduce carbon emissions. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, while wind turbines harness the power of moving air. Hydroelectric dams use flowing water to generate energy, and geothermal plants tap into the Earth's internal heat. These technologies offer cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, helping to combat climate change. Governments and companies are investing in research and infrastructure to make renewable energy more accessible and efficient for everyone.
