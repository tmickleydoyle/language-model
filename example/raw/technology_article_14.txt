Electric bicycles, or e-bikes, are becoming popular for commuting and recreation. E-bikes use a battery-powered motor to assist with pedaling, making it easier to travel long distances or climb hills. They are environmentally friendly and can reduce traffic congestion in cities. As technology improves, e-bikes are becoming more affordable and accessible, offering a convenient alternative to cars and public transportation.
