The process of digestion begins in the mouth, where food is broken down by chewing and saliva. It continues in the stomach, where acids and enzymes further break down food into nutrients. These nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine and transported throughout the body. The large intestine absorbs water and forms waste, which is eliminated from the body. Proper digestion is essential for health, providing the energy and nutrients needed for growth and repair.
