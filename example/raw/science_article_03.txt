The water cycle is a continuous process that moves water throughout the Earth. It begins with evaporation, where the sun heats water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into vapor. The vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools, forming clouds through condensation. When the clouds become heavy, precipitation occurs as rain, snow, or hail. The water then returns to the ground, replenishing rivers and lakes, and the cycle begins again. This process is essential for maintaining life, regulating climate, and shaping the landscape.
