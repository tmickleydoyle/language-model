The process of photosynthesis allows plants to convert sunlight into energy. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves, captures light and uses it to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is vital for life on Earth, providing food and oxygen for animals and humans. Scientists study photosynthesis to improve crop yields and develop new sources of renewable energy.
