The small town of Willow Creek was famous for its annual harvest fair. Every autumn, families gathered to celebrate with games, music, and homemade pies. This year, a new family moved to town, bringing with them a recipe for apple cider that quickly became the talk of the fair. The children made friends, the parents shared stories, and the fair ended with a fireworks display that lit up the night sky. Willow Creek was a place where everyone felt welcome, and the harvest fair was a reminder of the joy found in community.
