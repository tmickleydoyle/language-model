The water cycle is essential for life on Earth. Water evaporates from oceans and lakes, rises into the atmosphere, and forms clouds. When the clouds become heavy, precipitation falls as rain or snow. Water returns to the ground, replenishing rivers and aquifers. This cycle supports plants, animals, and people, and helps regulate the planet's climate. Protecting water resources is vital for a healthy environment.
