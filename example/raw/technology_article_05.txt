Virtual reality (VR) technology creates immersive digital environments that users can interact with using special headsets and controllers. Originally developed for gaming, VR is now used in education, healthcare, and training simulations. By simulating real-world scenarios, VR helps people learn new skills and experience places they might never visit in person. As hardware becomes more affordable and software more sophisticated, VR is expected to play a growing role in entertainment and professional development.
