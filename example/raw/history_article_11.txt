The Olympic Games began in ancient Greece over 2,700 years ago. Athletes from different city-states competed in events like running, wrestling, and discus throw. The games were held every four years in Olympia and were dedicated to the god Zeus. The modern Olympics, revived in 1896, bring together athletes from around the world to celebrate sportsmanship and unity. The games continue to inspire people of all ages.
