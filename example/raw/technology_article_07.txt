Cloud computing allows users to store and access data over the internet instead of on local devices. Services like email, file storage, and software applications are hosted on remote servers, making them accessible from anywhere. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost savings for businesses and individuals. Security and privacy are important considerations, and providers use encryption and other measures to protect data.
