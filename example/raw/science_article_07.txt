Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They provide habitat for thousands of marine species and protect coastlines from erosion. Coral reefs are formed by tiny animals called polyps, which build calcium carbonate skeletons. These structures grow over time, creating vibrant underwater landscapes. Climate change, pollution, and overfishing threaten coral reefs worldwide. Conservation efforts focus on reducing these threats and restoring damaged reefs to preserve their beauty and biodiversity.
