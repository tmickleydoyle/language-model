Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems can recognize speech, understand language, and make decisions. Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows computers to learn from data and improve over time. AI is used in many industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. As AI technology advances, it raises important questions about ethics, privacy, and the future of work.
