The city park was alive with the sounds of laughter and music during the summer festival. Food stalls lined the walkways, offering treats from around the world. In the center, a stage hosted performances by local musicians and dancers. Among the crowd, a boy named Sam watched in awe as a magician performed tricks with cards and coins. Inspired, Sam spent the rest of the day practicing sleight of hand, determined to become a magician himself. By evening, the park was aglow with lanterns, and Sam had made new friends who shared his love of magic and wonder.
