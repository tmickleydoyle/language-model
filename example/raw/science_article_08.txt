The process of evolution explains how species change over time. Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection describes how organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over generations, these traits become more common in the population. Fossil records, genetic studies, and observations of living species provide evidence for evolution. Understanding evolution helps scientists study biodiversity and the history of life on Earth.
