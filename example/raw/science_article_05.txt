The human brain is one of the most complex organs in the body. It controls thoughts, emotions, movement, and memory. The brain is made up of billions of neurons that communicate through electrical and chemical signals. Different regions of the brain are responsible for specific functions, such as vision, language, and decision-making. Scientists use advanced imaging techniques to study the brain and learn how it works. Understanding the brain helps doctors treat conditions like Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and depression.
