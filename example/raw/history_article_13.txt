The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, made history in 1903 with the first powered flight. Their airplane, the Flyer, took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and flew for 12 seconds. This achievement marked the beginning of modern aviation. The Wright brothers' work inspired inventors and engineers around the world, leading to the development of faster and safer airplanes. Today, air travel connects people and places across the globe.
