The mountain village was known for its annual lantern festival. Every year, families gathered to create colorful lanterns, each one representing a wish for the future. As night fell, the villagers released their lanterns into the sky, watching as they floated higher and higher. Among the crowd, a boy named Hiro hoped his lantern would reach his father, who worked far away. The festival brought the community together, filling the night with light, laughter, and hope for the year ahead.
