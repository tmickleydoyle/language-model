The ancient city of Rome was the center of a vast empire that shaped the course of history. Founded in 753 BCE, Rome grew from a small settlement to a powerful republic and then an empire. Roman engineers built roads, aqueducts, and monumental buildings that still stand today. The Romans developed a legal system, literature, and art that influenced later civilizations. The fall of Rome in 476 CE marked the end of the ancient world and the beginning of the Middle Ages.
