The process of photosynthesis is fundamental to life on Earth. Plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process takes place in the chloroplasts, where chlorophyll captures light energy. The glucose produced provides energy for the plant, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis not only sustains plants but also supports all life by producing the oxygen we breathe and forming the base of the food chain. Scientists continue to study photosynthesis to improve crop yields and develop new technologies for clean energy.
