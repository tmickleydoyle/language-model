Ecosystems are communities of living organisms interacting with their environment. Each ecosystem, from forests to oceans, has unique plants, animals, and climate. Biodiversity is important for ecosystem health, providing resilience against changes and supporting life. Human activities, such as deforestation and pollution, threaten many ecosystems. Conservation efforts aim to protect habitats and restore balance, ensuring that future generations can enjoy the planet's natural wonders.
