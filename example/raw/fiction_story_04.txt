The old lighthouse stood at the edge of the rocky shore, its beacon guiding ships safely through the fog. For generations, the keeper's family had tended the light, passing down stories of storms and shipwrecks. One stormy night, a young girl named Isla heard a faint cry for help. Braving the wind and rain, she followed the sound to the beach, where she found a stranded sailor. With courage and quick thinking, Isla helped the sailor to safety. The next morning, the storm had passed, and the sailor thanked Isla and her family for their kindness. The lighthouse continued to shine, a symbol of hope and safety for all who traveled the sea.
