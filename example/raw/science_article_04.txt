Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the movement of electrons. It powers homes, businesses, and countless devices. The discovery of electricity dates back to ancient times, but it was not until the 19th century that scientists like Michael Faraday and Thomas Edison developed ways to generate and use it efficiently. Today, electricity is produced from various sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy. Understanding how electricity works is essential for developing new technologies and ensuring a sustainable future.
