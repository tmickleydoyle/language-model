On the outskirts of town, a mysterious garden grew behind a tall, ivy-covered wall. No one knew who tended it, but every season, the flowers bloomed in dazzling colors. One spring, a group of children discovered a hidden gate and ventured inside. They found winding paths, secret ponds, and statues covered in moss. In the center stood an ancient tree with a door carved into its trunk. Inside, they found a journal filled with stories of the garden's magic. The children promised to keep the secret and returned often, finding new wonders each time.
