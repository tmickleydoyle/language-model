The neighborhood community garden was a place where people of all ages came together. Each spring, volunteers planted vegetables, herbs, and flowers. Children learned about nature and teamwork as they watered plants and pulled weeds. At harvest time, everyone shared the bounty, making fresh salads and soups. The garden became a symbol of cooperation and friendship, showing how small efforts could make a big difference.
