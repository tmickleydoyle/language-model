The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century revolutionized the spread of information. Before the printing press, books were copied by hand, making them rare and expensive. Gutenberg's invention allowed for the mass production of books, making knowledge more accessible to people across Europe. This led to an increase in literacy rates and the rapid spread of new ideas, fueling the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. The printing press is considered one of the most important inventions in human history.
