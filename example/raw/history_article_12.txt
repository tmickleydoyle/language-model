The Great Fire of London in 1666 was a devastating event that destroyed much of the city. The fire started in a bakery on Pudding Lane and quickly spread, fueled by wooden buildings and strong winds. Thousands of people lost their homes, but few lives were lost. The fire led to major changes in building codes and city planning, helping to make London safer for future generations.
