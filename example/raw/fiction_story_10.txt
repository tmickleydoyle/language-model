The bakery on Maple Street was famous for its cinnamon rolls. Every morning, the scent of fresh bread drifted through the neighborhood, drawing customers from blocks away. Mrs. Kim, the baker, greeted everyone with a smile and a story. She taught her granddaughter, Lily, the secrets of kneading dough and mixing spices. Together, they created new recipes and shared them with friends. The bakery became a gathering place, where people celebrated birthdays, shared news, and found comfort in the warmth of good food and company.
